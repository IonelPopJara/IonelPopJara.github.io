description: During the 2020 quarantine, I decided to start a <a href="https://YouTube.com/MultsElMesco" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> as a way to document my programming/robotics projects and practice another one of my favorite hobbies, video editing. <br> Originally, I focused solely on documenting my side projects but later I started making short videos showcasing common programmers frustrations in a fun way. <br> As of right now, my channel has gained a decent amount of subscribers and it's steadily gaining traction every day.
